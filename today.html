			<p>With the person sitting next to you, settle on two most important things that make for a good hypothesis and, thus, a good data story pitch.</p>
		<h3>Make your own small dataset!</h3>
			<p>** Option 1: Create a dataset in Google Sheets, including a header row, some values and a data dictionary, of everyone you've communicated with using your phone (via text, social media, phone call, etc.) this week. You can decide how to organize your dataset but be ready to explain your decisions.</p>
			<p>** Option 2: Create a dataset in Google Sheets, including a header row, some values and a data dictionary, of a hometown news organization's tweets for the past week. You can decide how to organize your dataset but be ready to explain your decisions.</p>

		<h3>Interview questions</h3>
			<p>Use our <a href="https://tinyurl.com/jnl221-survey" target="_blank">in-class survey data</a> from last week to answer the questions below. Copy the dataset, as is, into your own Google Sheet and do your work in your Sheet. Work on this with a partner in class, and complete as homework if you don't finish in class.</p>
 			<ol>
 				<li>What is the mode of Newhouse department in this dataset?</li>
 				<li>What is the percentage increase or decrease of students who used Instagram the most five years ago versus now?</li>
 				<li>Fill in the blank: “Students from the state of New York chose the superpower of accurately knowing how people are feeling _____ times more than students from the state of New Jersey.” (Hint: review page 19 of “Numbers In The Newsroom.”)</li>
 				<li>Fill in the blank: “BDJ students are _____ times more likely than MND students to have worked for a high school publication.” (Hint: review page 24 of “Numbers In The Newsroom.”)</li>
 				<li>For each section of data foundations, what is the percentage of lecture chosen versus percentage of discussion chosen as a learning style? (Hint: students sometimes chose more than one learning style in their responses, so think first about how to determine your denominator.)</li>
 				<li>You're working on a story about this new required data course at Newhouse and you want to write about how many students are or are not coming in with experience working with data or document tools. Write a short paragraph that contains two accurate and relevant statistics to add to this part of the story using this dataset.</li>

		<h3>To consume:</h3>
			<p>Review pivot table functionality in Google Sheets <a href="https://www.benlcollins.com/spreadsheets/pivot-tables-google-sheets/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
		<h3>To do:</h3>
			<p>1. Answer questions about <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BQvJfdDlmd2BfGqJYD1KwwbbX8_dTS-pJqg6wa2_vTM/edit#gid=318899647" target="_blank">a dataset on refugees in Rochester</a> using pivot tables. Use the videos on Blackboard in the 'Videos/resources' section as a resource.</p>
			<ol>
 				<li>What percentage of refugees in this dataset arrived in 1998? Show your work.</li>
 				<li>What is the percent change between refugees who arrived in 1998 and refugees who arrived in 2008? Show your work.</li>
 				<li>Which year saw the most stateless refugees arriving to Rochester, NY? Create a pivot table that helps you answer this question, and rename the tab ‘data_q4’.</li>
 				<li>What percentage of female refugees in this dataset were born in Bosnia And Herzegovina? Create a pivot table that helps you answer this question, and rename the tab ‘data_q5’.</li>
 				<li>During which years did Rochester, NY get more than 100 refugees from Bosnia and Herzegovina?</li>
 				<li>Short answer: Do some research on these years and what was going on in Bosnia And Herzegovina. Write two paragraphs about why these years may have produced many refugees. Please cite your sources; please do not cite Wikipedia as a source.</li>
 				<li>List the countries that have a 50% or higher percentage of refugees coming in with ‘good’ ability in writing in English. Create a pivot table that helps you answer this question, and rename the tab ‘data_q8’.</li>
 				<li>List the years where Rochester had 30 or more unique birth countries represented in its incoming refugee population. (Hint: You will need to use COUNTUNIQUE for this). Create a pivot table that helps you answer this question, and rename the tab ‘data_q9’.</li>
 				<li>From which birth countries did widowed people arrive to Rochester, NY completely alone?</li>
 			</ol>
			<p>2. Find two public datasets that you think could be relevant for a central New York audience; at least one public dataset must be compiled by a government entity. Submit a link for each and a paragraph (a few sentences, at least) explaining why they are relevant and newsworthy. You should use MuckRock and FOIAMapper for inspiration on what government entities may have public datasets.</p>

		<h3>Redesigning a dataset</h3>
			<p>1. Take a look at <a href="https://tinyurl.com/activedutydata" target="_blank">this spreadsheet</a>, which has a few issues.</p>
			<p>2. Redesign this dataset in your team on your poster paper. You don’t have to write down every value, but you must note down what your variables will be, and explain what each observation/instance is (‘one row is ____’).</p>
			<p>3. Read the website the data comes from. Write a data_dict on the poster.</p>
			<p>4. In the data_diary section, write down three transformations you’d do to this dataset, not including the base design. What would you add? Calculate? Highlight? Fix? What would help your reporting?</p>
			<p>5. Write down at least one story idea/hypothesis for this dataset. Write down at least two options for who you’d reach out to if you had questions about this data.</p>
			<p>6. When you’re done, stick your poster up on the wall! Fastest and most accurate team wins!</p>

		<h3>To consume:</h3>
			<p>Listen to the <a href="https://www.publicbooks.org/episode-1-data-humanity/" target="_blank"> Data & Humanity podcast</a> with Mimi Onuoha and Lam Thuy Vo. Come prepared to discuss this episode at length on 9/20.</p>
		<h3> To do:</h3>
			<p>Choose an existing data set online and write a one-page paper on why it would be considered a good data source for a news story. This doesn't have to be a government data source, but it should be a dataset you are interested in. Explain the source of the data, the reason it was collected and potential limitations it may have. Include at least one story idea for this dataset. Some questions you could address in this paper: How was this data collected? Why is the method of data collection trustworthy and sound? What are the limitations of this data? Who could you talk to about this data? In what ways is this data valuable? What stories could you pursue with this dataset?<br>
			Papers should by Times New Roman font, size 12, with normal margins and borders. Please make sure your name and "Data literacy assignment #1" is at the top of the paper, and please make sure the title of the paper is the name of the dataset. Please include a link to the dataset at the top of the paper.</p>
