			<p>With the person sitting next to you, settle on two most important things that make for a good hypothesis and, thus, a good data story pitch.</p>
		<h3>Make your own small dataset!</h3>
			<p>** Option 1: Create a dataset in Google Sheets, including a header row, some values and a data dictionary, of everyone you've communicated with using your phone (via text, social media, phone call, etc.) this week. You can decide how to organize your dataset but be ready to explain your decisions.</p>
			<p>** Option 2: Create a dataset in Google Sheets, including a header row, some values and a data dictionary, of a hometown news organization's tweets for the past week. You can decide how to organize your dataset but be ready to explain your decisions.</p>

		<h3>Interview questions</h3>
			<p>Use our <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1i7Oitb5y0sURxsYYEMmYCit0c6DNYytNW3-k5OW6ItI/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">in-class survey data</a> from last week to answer the questions below. Copy the dataset, as is, into your own Google Sheet and do your work in your Sheet. Work on this with a partner in class, and complete as homework if you don't finish in class.</p>
 			<ol>
 				<li>What is the mode of Newhouse department in this dataset?</li>
 				<li>What is the percentage increase or decrease of students who used Twitter the most five years ago versus now?</li>
 				<li>Take the absolute number of any superpower chosen and make it a rate using the where_from column (use the state the person is from, not the city).</li>
 				<li>In these sections, who is more likely to have worked for a high school publication, an MND student or a BDJ student? Refer to page 24 of “Numbers In The Newsroom.”</li>
 				<li>For each section of data foundations, what is the percentage of each type of learning chosen? (Hint - A potential answer would look like this in a sentence: ‘For the 12:45PM section, students chose discussion as a learning style 40% of the time.’ Your answer can be a list of sentences like this, or just the section, learning style and percentage.)</li>
 				<li>You're working on a story about this new required data course at Newhouse and you want to write about how many students are or are not coming in with experience working with data or document tools. Write a paragraph that contains two accurate and relevant statistics to add to this part of the story using this dataset.</li>
