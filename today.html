			<p>With the person sitting next to you, settle on two most important things that make for a good hypothesis and, thus, a good data story pitch.</p>
		<h3>Make your own small dataset!</h3>
			<p>** Option 1: Create a dataset in Google Sheets, including a header row, some values and a data dictionary, of everyone you've communicated with using your phone (via text, social media, phone call, etc.) this week. You can decide how to organize your dataset but be ready to explain your decisions.</p>
			<p>** Option 2: Create a dataset in Google Sheets, including a header row, some values and a data dictionary, of a hometown news organization's tweets for the past week. You can decide how to organize your dataset but be ready to explain your decisions.</p>

		<h3>Interview questions</h3>
			<p>Use our <a href="https://tinyurl.com/jnl221-survey" target="_blank">in-class survey data</a> from last week to answer the questions below. Copy the dataset, as is, into your own Google Sheet and do your work in your Sheet. Work on this with a partner in class, and complete as homework if you don't finish in class.</p>
 			<ol>
 				<li>What is the mode of Newhouse department in this dataset?</li>
 				<li>What is the percentage increase or decrease of students who used Instagram the most five years ago versus now?</li>
 				<li>Fill in the blank: “Students from the state of New York chose the superpower of accurately knowing how people are feeling _____ times more than students from the state of New Jersey.” (Hint: review page 19 of “Numbers In The Newsroom.”)</li>
 				<li>Fill in the blank: “BDJ students are _____ times more likely than MND students to have worked for a high school publication.” (Hint: review page 24 of “Numbers In The Newsroom.”)</li>
 				<li>For each section of data foundations, what is the percentage of lecture chosen versus percentage of discussion chosen as a learning style? (Hint: students sometimes chose more than one learning style in their responses, so think first about how to determine your denominator.)</li>
 				<li>You're working on a story about this new required data course at Newhouse and you want to write about how many students are or are not coming in with experience working with data or document tools. Write a short paragraph that contains two accurate and relevant statistics to add to this part of the story using this dataset.</li>

		<h2>homework assignment</h2>
		<p class="subhed">due on 9/11/21 at 11:59PM</p>
		<h3>To consume:</h3>
			<p>Review pivot table functionality in Google Sheets <a href="https://www.benlcollins.com/spreadsheets/pivot-tables-google-sheets/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
		<h3>To do:</h3>
			<p>1. Answer questions about <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BQvJfdDlmd2BfGqJYD1KwwbbX8_dTS-pJqg6wa2_vTM/edit#gid=318899647" target="_blank">a dataset on refugees in Rochester</a> using pivot tables. Use the videos on Blackboard in the 'Videos/resources' section as a resource.</p>
			<ol>
 				<li>What percentage of refugees in this dataset arrived in 1998? Show your work.</li>
 				<li>What is the percent change between refugees who arrived in 1998 and refugees who arrived in 2008? Show your work.</li>
 				<li>Which year saw the most stateless refugees arriving to Rochester, NY? Create a pivot table that helps you answer this question, and rename the tab ‘data_q4’.</li>
 				<li>What percentage of female refugees in this dataset were born in Bosnia And Herzegovina? Create a pivot table that helps you answer this question, and rename the tab ‘data_q5’.</li>
 				<li>During which years did Rochester, NY get more than 100 refugees from Bosnia and Herzegovina?</li>
 				<li>Short answer: Do some research on these years and what was going on in Bosnia And Herzegovina. Write two paragraphs about why these years may have produced many refugees. Please cite your sources; please do not cite Wikipedia as a source.</li>
 				<li>List the countries that have a 50% or higher percentage of refugees coming in with ‘good’ ability in writing in English. Create a pivot table that helps you answer this question, and rename the tab ‘data_q8’.</li>
 				<li>List the years where Rochester had 30 or more unique birth countries represented in its incoming refugee population. (Hint: You will need to use COUNTUNIQUE for this). Create a pivot table that helps you answer this question, and rename the tab ‘data_q9’.</li>
 				<li>From which birth countries did widowed people arrive to Rochester, NY completely alone?</li>
 			</ol>
			<p>2. Find two public datasets that you think could be relevant for a central New York audience; at least one public dataset must be compiled by a government entity. Submit a link for each and a paragraph (a few sentences, at least) explaining why they are relevant and newsworthy. You should use MuckRock and FOIAMapper for inspiration on what government entities may have public datasets.</p>
