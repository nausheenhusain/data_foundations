		<h3>Datawrapping on deadline</h3>
			<p>You are part of a data reporting team in a newsroom! Your reporter colleague has just sent you a story and a dataset and they need you to make a quick chart displaying one of four findings. The story is <a href="https://jnl221.github.io/" target="_blank">here</a>, and the dataset is <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fzEO7nkmHtgR8NJ1PH1pg1LsvAK7mEl3j-eLsEJlHBQ/edit#gid=0" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
			<p>In your teams, make copies of the dataset. Start by trying to recreate the pivot table(s) and calculation(s) that got to the finding. Then, brainstorm what kind of chart would be best to display this finding. You should use FT Visual Vocabulary [https://ft-interactive.github.io/visual-vocabulary/] to choose a chart type. Think about what trend the finding is trying to describe and what kind of chart would best show that trend, not just the number that is the actual finding.</p>
			<p>When you have a sketch, work together to get through the steps in Datawrapper to create a chart. You should use a color palette generator [https://coolors.co/] to choose your colors, and you should think intentionally about your design. Use annotations and highlights where possible to emphasize certain data points or trends.</p>
			<p>When you are done with your chart, hit the publish button and copy the embed code. Paste your embed code into <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iTc0VF_5gWyimeKnDroZunH0M6-O8zGaF8qpTtR0J4c/edit" target="_blank">this document</a>.</p>

		<h2>homework assignment</h2>
		<p class="subhed">due on 10/17/21 at noon</p>
		<h3> To do:</h3>
			<p>Your goal here is to publish a repository with the content and styles of <a href="https://jnl221.github.io/" target="_blank">this page</a>, just slightly edited. Follow these steps carefully:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/download" target="_blank">Download Sublime Text</a>. Use this instead of TextEdit, which is likely the default text editor on your machine.</li>
				<li>Go to this page [https://github.com/jnl221/jnl221.github.io]. Click on the green button that says 'Code' and click on 'Download zip.' This will download all the code files to your machine.</li>
				<li>Click on the downloaded zip folder in order to unzip it. Move it to your desktop for ease of access.</li>
				<li>In this folder, open the file called 'index.css'. If you right-click on it, you can open it in Sublime Text, which is different from Word, but allows you to edit code. In this file, click command + A to highlight everything, and then command + C to copy.</li>
				<li>Go to your Github account, which you created yesterday. Get to your repositories page.</li>
				<li>On the top right of your repositories page, click on the green button that says 'New.' Name your repository 'jnl221_lastname'.</li>
				<li>In the description box, write '____'s JNL221 assignments page'.</li>
				<li>Make sure the site is 'Public' and click on 'Add a README file'. Then, click 'Create repository'.</li>
				<li>If you are successful, you will land on your repository's home page. From there, click on 'Settings' in the top right. Scroll down to Github Pages and click on 'Check it out here!'
				</li>
				<li>Under 'Source' click on 'main'. Make sure 'root' is chosen, then click on 'Save.'</li>
				<li>A pop-up will tell you where your site is live. Command + click on this and save this URL in a different tab for later! (It's okay if it says 'Site not found' for now -- you have no code yet!)</li>
				<li>Back in your repository page, on the top left, click on Code. Then, click on 'Add file' > 'Create new file'.</li>
				<li>Name this file index.css and paste in what you copied from your text editor in step #3.</li>
				<li>Scroll down to 'Commit new file' and in the top box type 'initial commit, adds css file.' Then, click on 'Commit new file'.</li>
				<li>In your unzipped folder, right-click on section-one.html (for students in the 12:45pm course) or section-two.html (for students in the 3:45pm course), go to 'Open with' and open the file with Sublime.</li>
				<li>Find the text /// EDITABLE ONE /// . In the text following it, change 'Foundations Of Data And Digital Journalism' to 'JNL221, Fall 2021, 12:45' or 'JNL221, Fall 2021, 3:45'.</li>
				<li>Find the text /// EDITABLE TWO /// . In the text following it, change 'Syracuse University, Fall 2021' to your full name.</li>
				<li>Find the text /// EDITABLE THREE /// . In the text following it, change 'By JNL221, Syracuse University' to 'By Your Name, JNL221'.</li>
				<li>Find the text /// EDITABLE FOUR /// . In the text following it, change 'this page was published by github pages. fonts: montserrat, open sans.' to 'made by github pages with montserrat and open sans, at newhouse school of communications'.</li>
				<li>Use command + A and command + C to copy this file. Back in your Github repository, click on 'Add file' > 'Create new file'.</li>
				<li>Name this file index.html. In it, paste what you copied. Scroll down to 'Commit new file' and in the top box type 'initial commit, adds index'. Then, click on 'Commit new file'.</li>
				<li>Go to your site page (from #11) and after a couple of minutes, refresh. Your content should be on the page, styled similarly to the original page.</li>

		<h3>Datawrapper work with feedback</h3>
			<p>Make one Datawrapper-produced chart with any data you’d like (hint: if you experiment with the data you used for your dataset memo, you’re making progress on your midterm!). Before you leave class, you are to do the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>With your partner, discuss your individual charts and share feedback. Think about whether or not the chart style conveys information accurately, whether the charts are easy to understand, if the design elements (color, ticks, annotations) make sense and add anything useful to the chart, and the accuracy and readability of any text, like hed/subhed, labels, legends, etc.</li>
				<li>Add a screenshot or PNG, public link to your chart and your name in your class’ doc: 12:45 https://tinyurl.com/jnl221-chart1245 or 3:45 https://tinyurl.com/jnl221-chart345</li>
				<li>Under the link, write me a note about the decisions you made for this chart and why: Why did you choose the type of chart you did? What data series did you choose to represent? How did you go about making the aesthetic choices you did? What feedback did you get from your partner and how did you incorporate it? What did you struggle with? This should be a practice in examining your design choices because they should be intentional.</li>

		<h3>Data diary legibility</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Using the dataset you’ve chosen, choose two questions you want to ‘ask.’ They should be more complex than simple sums, but simple enough that you can use Sheets tools or pivot tables to find the answers. (Example: For a dataset on COVID numbers in New York State, including Syracuse, 'How many total cases were there in Syracuse today?' would be too simple, but 'What is the percent change of COVID cases from this time last year to now in Syracuse?' or 'What is the COVID case rate in Syracuse compared to the state of New York?' would be good.)</li>
				<li>Work on answering the two questions in your Sheet (keep your raw data untouched!). You must use three Sheets tool functions or math functions. You must produce a thorough data diary in a separate tab. Clearly label your findings, your data diary, your raw data.</li>
				<li>Share your Sheet with your assigned partner. Follow your partners’ data diary and see if you can reproduce their findings. If you have suggestions on how to make their directions clearer, or if you think they got to one of their findings in a flawed way, use the comment function in Sheets to give them feedback.</li>
				<li>Discuss your sheet with your partner and use the feedback they gave you to improve your data diary.</li>

		<h3> To do:</h3>
			<p>Choose an existing data set online and write a one-page paper on why it would be considered a good data source for a news story. This doesn't have to be a government data source, but it should be a dataset you are interested in. Explain the source of the data, the reason it was collected and potential limitations it may have. Include at least one story idea for this dataset. Some questions you could address in this paper: How was this data collected? Why is the method of data collection trustworthy and sound? What are the limitations of this data? Who could you talk to about this data? In what ways is this data valuable? What stories could you pursue with this dataset?<br>
			Papers should by Times New Roman font, size 12, with normal margins and borders. Please make sure your name and "Data literacy assignment #1" is at the top of the paper, and please make sure the title of the paper is the name of the dataset.

			<p>3. Read the website the data comes from. Write a data_dict on the poster.</p>
			<p>4. In the data_diary section, write down three transformations you’d do to this dataset, not including the base design. What would you add? Calculate? Highlight? Fix? What would help your reporting?</p>
			<p>5. Write down at least one story idea/hypothesis for this dataset. Write down at least two options for who you’d reach out to if you had questions about this data.</p>
			<p>6. When you’re done, stick your poster up on the wall! Fastest and most accurate team wins!</p>

Write a short paragraph that contains two accurate and relevant statistics to add to this part of the story using this dataset.</li>
