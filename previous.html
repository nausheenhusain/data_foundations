		<h3>Interview questions</h3>
			<p>Use our <a href="https://tinyurl.com/jnl221-survey" target="_blank">in-class survey data</a> from last week to answer the questions below. Copy the dataset, as is, into your own Google Sheet and do your work in your Sheet. Work on this with a partner in class, and complete as homework if you don't finish in class.</p>
 			<ol>
 				<li>What is the mode of Newhouse department in this dataset?</li>
 				<li>What is the percentage increase or decrease of students who used Instagram the most five years ago versus now?</li>
 				<li>Fill in the blank: “Students from the state of New York chose the superpower of accurately knowing how people are feeling _____ times more than students from the state of New Jersey.” (Hint: review page 19 of “Numbers In The Newsroom.”)</li>
 				<li>Fill in the blank: “BDJ students are _____ times more likely than MND students to have worked for a high school publication.” (Hint: review page 24 of “Numbers In The Newsroom.”)</li>
 				<li>For each section of data foundations, what is the percentage of lecture chosen versus percentage of discussion chosen as a learning style? (Hint: students sometimes chose more than one learning style in their responses, so think first about how to determine your denominator.)</li>
 				<li>You're working on a story about this new required data course at Newhouse and you want to write about how many students are or are not coming in with experience working with data or document tools. Write a short paragraph that contains two accurate and relevant statistics to add to this part of the story using this dataset.</li>

			<p>With the person sitting next to you, settle on two most important things that make for a good hypothesis and, thus, a good data story pitch.</p>
		<h3>Make your own small dataset!</h3>
			<p>** Option 1: Create a dataset in Google Sheets, including a header row, some values and a data dictionary, of everyone you've communicated with using your phone (via text, social media, phone call, etc.) this week. You can decide how to organize your dataset but be ready to explain your decisions.</p>
			<p>** Option 2: Create a dataset in Google Sheets, including a header row, some values and a data dictionary, of a hometown news organization's tweets for the past week. You can decide how to organize your dataset but be ready to explain your decisions.</p>
